# CIE_A-level_chemistry_organic_rxns_practice
contains equations from "Cambridge International AS &amp; A Level Chemistry 9701 syllabus for 2025, 2026 and 2027."
File "organicrxn_tester_3.py" is complete and I used it to prepare for my AS Chemistry exams.

You will be prompted to specify which categories you want to show from type of reaction, organic reagent, inorganic reagent, conditions, organic product and inorganic product. For example, you could enter `1,3,4`, or `rand`, and your test will start.

Each time you are given the categories, see if you can name the other categories, then press "enter" to reveal the answers. If you got everything right, press enter again and you will go on to the next question. If you found that you were wrong after revealing the answers, type `n` and press enter, and the question will be saved for later while you continue with a new question. Once you have gone through each reaction, you will be told `You were unsure with these rxns.` and asked to redo the questions you got wrong. For those questions, you can store them again for later by inputting `n` after revealing the answers until you have confidently completed all questions. You are done when you see `congrats`.
